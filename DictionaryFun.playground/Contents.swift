/*: question1

 ### 2. What is the type of the dictionary you created in Question 1?
 */

//[String : String]


/*: question3
 ### 3. Create a variable called `capital` and assign to it Florida's capital from the dictionary.
 */
// write your code here

/*: question4
 ### 4. Unwrap `capital` and print out the message "The capital of Florida is <Capital>" to the console.
 */

/*: question5
 ### 5. Create a variable called `anotherCapital` and assign to it the value of Pennsylvania's capital from the dictionary.
 */
// write your code here

/*: question6
 ### 6. Unwrap `anotherCapital` and print out the message "I don't know Pennsylvania's capital" to the console.
 */

/*: question7
 ### 7. Pennsylvania's capital is Harrisburg. Add it to your state capitals dictionary.
 */
// write your code here

 ### 8. Retrieve Pennsylvania's capital from your dictionary. Unwrap it and print the message "Pennsylvania's capital is <Capital>" to the console.
 */

 */
// write your code here

/*: question10
 ### 10. You have been given the constant `state` with a state name. Use that constant to retrieve the state's capital from the dictionary. Print "The capital of <State> is <Capital>" to the console.
 */

 //write your code here

}

/*: question11
 ### 11. Dictionaries don't have to contain just `String` keys and values. Create a dictionary that contains the name of a band, and the members of that band. Here are the bands and members that you can use:

 * Nirvana: Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, Dave Grohl
 * The Beatles: John Lennon, George Harrison, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr
 * The Breeders: Kim Deal, Kelley Deal, Josephine Wiggs, Jim Macpherson
 * Pixies: Frank Black, Joey Santiago, Kim Deal, David Lovering

 Since there are multiple members for each band, the value of each key should be an `Array`.

/*: question12
 ### 12. What is the type of the dictionary you created in Question 11?
 */
//[String : Array<String>]



/*: question13
 ### 13. You have been given a band name in the constant `band` below. Use that band name to retrieve its list of members from the array you created in Question 11. Then unwrap that list of members and print it to the console.
